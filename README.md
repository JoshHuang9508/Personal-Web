# Personal Web

## What is this

- This is a personal website built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Redux**, and **Socket.io**. It serves as a self-introduction page and hosts some cool web-based tools. The entire site is controlled via a built-in command line interface (CLI) — no buttons needed!
